Classical Christian Education — The curriculum at Trinity Classical Academy of Summerville is based on the Core Knowledge Sequence (the Sequence should not be confused with Common Core).

The Core Knowledge Curriculum is systematic and sequential, providing children with a strong foundation of knowledge. Students perform very competitively on yearly standardized testing in language arts, math, science, and social studies.

By using a classical curriculum, which focuses on the core knowledge subjects, Trinity Classical Academy is able to abbreviate the school day from 8:00AM to 1:30PM. This schedule allows students to achieve the following goals:

* Students prepare quality assignments.
* Students explore topics of interest to them.
* Students read in an environment conducive for them to retain the material and have free reading time.
* Students participate in extracurricular activities and cultural events without sacrificing academic goals.

Trinity Classical Academy emphasizes course content that is vital to success in high school and college in an environment that fosters independence, self-control, and self-confidence. Technology is integrated throughout the curriculum to ensure students are sophisticated consumers and developers of technology.

Students enroll in Bethany UMC’s aftercare program if parents’ work schedules do not permit 1:30PM pick up.
